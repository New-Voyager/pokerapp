# When we send the FLOP, TURN, RIVER message to the Hand->All subject, and then
# YOUR_ACTION message to the Hand->Player subject immediately after, I see that sometimes
# the bot receives YOUR_ACTION message first. This means that the message ordering
# is not guaranteed across the 2 subjects.
# Have some delay around the broadcast message to make sure the client receives broadcast messages
# such as FLOP, TURN, RIVER and the unicast messages such as YOUR_ACTION in the correct
# order.
